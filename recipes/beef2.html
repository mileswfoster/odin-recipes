<h2>About this recipe...</h2>
<p>You have never had corned beef like this and if you try it,
I truly believe you will never go back to the traditionally 'boiled' beef. 
This recipe was given to my mother-in-law during WWII by her Jewish boarding 
house owner and it has become a treasured family recipe. Unlike the commonly boiled corned beef,
 this is a slow braise that is tender, flavorful, and has a caramelized surface when it's done. 
 I serve it with colcannon, steamed cabbage wedges, braised carrots, and parsnips. 
 It is our favorite St. Patrick's/Jewish dinner, but we love it so much that I cook it year around.</p>
